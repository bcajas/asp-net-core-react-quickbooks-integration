Example of how to access QuickBooks Online via ASP.NET Core 2 &amp; OpenID Connect Provider

This is a minimal sample that displays customers from QuickBooks Online.  It is not intended to be used as a production solution.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a project up and running that demonstrates everything you need to build an ASP.NET Core 2 web application that will use the single sign on capabilities of QuickBooks online usinge the Microsoft supplied OpenId Connect authentication provider.  You can also clone this repro and run the application after making a couple of minor changes to specify your QuickBooks App Client ID and Client Secret as well as add your web applications redirect URI in your QBO App configuration.
